# Kobold Press OGL Compendium (A5E)

This is a conversion of the [Kobold Press OGL Compendium module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/koboldpressogl) content, making it compatible with the A5e Foundry system. This is purely a data format conversion, and no spells or monsters have been adjusted for the Level Up Advanced 5th Edition rule set.
